New in v0.1.1 (2002/09/16)
--------------------------

Supports asymmetric encryption with GPG public keys using the
--encrypt-key option.

Added option --sign-key.  When backing up, files are signed with the
given key.  When restoring, remote files are required to be signed by
given key.

Now duplicity checks the hash data found in the manifest file.  The
previous version generated SHA1 hashes but did not check them when
restoring.

Fixed GnuPG broken pipe error.  In the previous version certain
partial restores would end with a spurious GnuPG error message.


New in v0.1.0 (2002/08/26)
--------------------------

First real version.
